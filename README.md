# Radiomics-Based Analysis of Emotional Conflict fMRI Predicts Sertraline Response in Major Depressive Disorder

This repository contains code and documentation for a research project that aims to predict treatment outcomes in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) using sertraline. The project leverages radiomics features extracted from emotional conflict fMRI data of the amygdala, with insights derived from the EMBARC dataset.

## Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Predict treatment outcomes for MDD patients undergoing sertraline therapy by analyzing radiomics features from fMRI data focused on the amygdala during emotional conflict tasks.

- **Dataset:**  
  EMBARC (Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care)

- **Approach:**  
  - **Data Preprocessing:** fMRI preprocessing including motion correction, spatial normalization, and ROI extraction (amygdala).  
  - **Feature Extraction:** Use radiomics techniques to extract quantitative imaging features from the fMRI data.  
  - **Modeling:** Apply statistical and machine learning methods to build predictive models of treatment response.

## Repository Contents

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Scripts for cleaning and preparing fMRI data for analysis.

- **Feature Extraction:**  
  Tools and scripts to compute radiomics features from the emotional conflict fMRI scans.

- **Modeling & Evaluation:**  
  Notebooks and scripts for training, validating, and evaluating predictive models.

- **Documentation:**  
  Additional notes, references, and resources related to the study and methodologies used.
